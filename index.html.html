             <h1> My Project from scratch </h1>
		 <p style="font-size:50px;"> About Me! </p>
							<p> Hey! Welcome to My site. My name is Ndeli Albert.
				 I am a Cameroonian Living in the USA. 
				 I just stated my career program to become a computer programmer. 
				 I am so much excited about it. I have always love to work with computers.
				 So, studying what I have always loved all my live is such a great thing to me.
				Visit my YouTube Channel Here... </p>
				
				<p>	 I know so many things when it comes to computers, but unfortunately, 
				 I had not specialized on any.
				 Being in school and taking this classes now is already 
				 helping me to figure out what area to specialize in.
				 So far, I am beginning to consider web designing as an option 
				 for my specialization though not too sure since I am still
				 uncovering other areas of studies...This web site is my school 
				 project and where I do all my basic trainings on web page
				 building. With the steady changes in computer technology 
				 today, it is no doubt that there are great and more greater 
				 challenges in the field. To be up the ladder, is not
				 determined by the longevity in the field as the 
				 technology we have today is Not the same as it was half a decade ago.
				 Thus, to meet up with the constant changes in technology
				today is to keep update of the latest and or resent changes in Technology </p>
				
				
				<p> Just as I made mention in the introduction. 
				 My objective is to become a web designer and a programmer,
				 with some good knowledge on macro and micro computer hardware.
				 I would like to specialize on either web design or Programming, 
				 then have at least 20% idea on any other field of computer.
				 My reason is because when I graduate on any of the two mentioned
				 area under consideration, and then get employment anywhere,
				 I will be able to provide computer support in my job environment,
				 colleagues and friends. </p>
				
			<p>I have travelled to so many Places and Countries around the world. 
				In America, Asia, Middle East and Africa.
				I have not been to Europe, but planning to go there some day.
				Travelling is a very important aspect of life.
				It helps you meet people of different culture, religion and beliefs.
				it widens your understanding of how the world is. And also makes
				opportunity to learn new languages. 
				Travelling equally allows you to see how life is like on the other side, 
				compare to where you are coming from.
				Apart from English that I speak,
				Travelling has helped me to be able to speak other 
                languages, such as;
					<ul> 
					<li> Thai </li> 
					<li> Spanish </li>
					<li> French</li>
					<li> Malay</li>
                    </ul>
